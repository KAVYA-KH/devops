### What is CI
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.
By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.

### What is CD
Continuous Deployment is closely related to Continuous Integration and refers to the release into production of software that passes the automated tests.
"Essentially, it is the practice of releasing every good build to users‚Äù, explains Jez Humble, author of Continuous Delivery.
