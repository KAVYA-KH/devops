### What is CI
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.
By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.

### What is CD
Continuous Deployment is closely related to Continuous Integration and refers to the release into production of software that passes the automated tests.
"Essentially, it is the practice of releasing every good build to users‚Äù, explains Jez Humble, author of Continuous Delivery.

## Scripting 
Bash - for a short script that might need a for loop to do something repetitively.
Perl - anything to do with some kind of text processing or file processing, especially if it's a one off. Just do a dirty nasty perl script and be done with it
Python - If it's something you might want to do again or something very like it. Then at least you have a chance of being able to reuse the script.
