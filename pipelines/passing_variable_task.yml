steps:

  # Sets FOO to be "some value" in the script and the next ones
  - bash: |
      FOO="some value"
      echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=FOO]$FOO"

  # Using the $() syntax, the value is replaced inside Azure Pipelines before being submitted to the script task
  - bash: |
      echo "$(FOO)"

  # The same variable is also present as environmental variable in scripts; here the variable expansion happens within bash
  - bash: |
      echo "$FOO"
 
 # You can also use the $(FOO) syntax inside task definitions. For example, these steps copy files to a folder whose name is defined as variable:
 
  - bash: |
      echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=TARGET_FOLDER]$(Pipeline.Workspace)/target"
  
  - task: CopyFiles@2
    inputs:
      sourceFolder: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)
      # Note the use of the variable TARGET_FOLDER
      targetFolder: $(TARGET_FOLDER)/myfolder
